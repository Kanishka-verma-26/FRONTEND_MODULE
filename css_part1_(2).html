  <h1><u>VOLLEYBALL</u><span>(paragraph)</span> </h1>
</div>

  <p><em>Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are
    separated by a net. Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the
    other team's court under organized rules. It has been a part of the official
    program of the Summer Olympic Games since Tokyo 1964. Beach volleyball was
    introduced to the programme at the Atlanta 1996. The adapted version of volleyball
    at the Summer Paralympic Games is sitting volleyball. Each team consists of six players.[18] To get play started, a team is chosen to serve by coin toss. A player from the serving team throws the ball into the air and attempts to hit the ball so it passes over the net on a course such that it will land in the opposing team's court (the serve).[18] The opposing team must use a combination of no more than three contacts with the volleyball to return the ball to the opponent's side of the net.[18] These contacts usually consist first of the bump or pass so that the ball's trajectory is aimed towards the player designated as the setter; second of the set (usually an over-hand pass using wrists to push finger-tips at the ball) by the setter so that the ball's trajectory is aimed towards a spot where one of the players designated as an attacker can hit it, and third by the attacker who spikes (jumping, raising one arm above the head and hitting the ball so it will move quickly down to the ground on the opponent's court)
    to return the ball over the net.[3] The team with possession of the ball that is trying to attack the ball as described is said to be on offence.</em></p>
