<h3>today I completed my CSS ADVANCE module, I learnt the concepts of borders, backgrounds, using different styles of text i.e. not predefined in the css, adding images to the background, etc.
I updated my existing tagging html file with these concepts so that we can easily define the difference between the old and the new file</h3>.
